# Card Hero
JS card game.

Card assets from the 'The Witcher 3'.

Initial inspiration from mmtuts youtube JS tutorials. 

# TODOs:
- Improve attack logic
- UI (arena, replace alerts, prepare for player state, etc)
- Other actions
- Player state & saving
- RPG player leveling
- Audio?

# CODE TODOs:
- Look for alternate way to inject HTML, perhaps using create and append methods
- (Architecture) Decouple ui changes from logic / data manipulation (e.g. presenter -> controller -> data-layer, MVC, etc)
