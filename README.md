# Card Hero
JS card game.

Card assets from the 'The Witcher 3'.

Initial inspiration from mmtuts youtube JS tutorials. 

# TODOs:
- UI (arena, replace alerts, prepare for player state, etc)

- When action btn is toggled, its opacity changes until another another one is toggled

- Player depletion & recharge of agility
- Special Ability: Can only be used once per round

- Player state & saving
- RPG player leveling (e.g. XP)
- Audio?

- Better blocking logic

# CODE TODOs:
- (Architecture) Decouple ui changes from logic / data manipulation (e.g. presenter -> controller -> data-layer, MVC, etc)
- Character singleton?
- Config file (for CSS names, etc)?

# Bugs:
- Info button does not work on mobile
